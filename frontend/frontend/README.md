# Hotel Booking System - Frontend (React)

This folder contains the complete frontend application for the Hotel Booking System, built with **React** and **Vite**.

This user interface communicates with a separate backend server to fetch and manage all data.

-----

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

  * **Node.js and npm:** (version 18 or higher recommended) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)

## üöÄ How to Run the Frontend

**Important:** For the application to be fully functional, the backend server must be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

1.  **Navigate to this Directory:**
    Open your terminal and make sure you are inside this specific `frontend` directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install all the necessary libraries. This only needs to be done once.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the installation is complete, run this command to start the application:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **View the Application:**
    The terminal will show you a local URL, which is typically `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your web browser to see the live application.
